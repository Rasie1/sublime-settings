## Sublime Text plugin for Idris language

- Syntax definition is developed based on the [SublimeHaskell](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell) plugin using the [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) plugin for converting `YAML` to `tmLanguage`.
- `WIP` [Interactive editing](http://edwinb.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/interactive-idris-editing-with-vim/) functionality:
  + You have to start idris REPL server manually.
  + It calls `idris --client` with commands like `:addclause!`, just writing to your file (it doesn't use `--ideslave`).
  + There are some problems with this in idris itself: [idris-vim#11](https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-vim/issues/11) for example.
  + The following commands are added to the Command Palette:
    - `Idris: Run REPL command...` (any command for the REPL)
    - `Idris: Run editing command...` (this will be apended by the line number and the symbol name)
    - `Idris: Add clause` (`:addclause!` for current symbol)
    - `Idris: Case split` (`:casesplit!` for current symbol)
    - `Idris: Add missing clause` (`:addmissing!` for current symbol)
    - `Idris: Proof search` (`:proofsearch!` for current symbol)
    - `Idris: Make with pattern` (`:makewith!` for current symbol)


### Project status

I'm not using Sublime Text currently, so I'm not going to maintain this plugin. Although it can be still useful, mainly because of the improved syntax highlighting. If somebody wants to maintain it, please write me in an issue.


### TODO list

Things that would be nice to have.

- Optional keybindings
- Launch REPL server automatically
- Syntax definition for the literate source format
- Possibly some integration with [SublimeREPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL) (idris support is [almost there](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL/pull/354)) + [LoadFileTpRepl](https://github.com/laughedelic/LoadFileToRepl) (idris is already there)
- Proper interaction with the `idris --ideslave` mode.
